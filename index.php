	<p class="subhead" id="Dinner"><img src="images/SMTurtle.jpg" class="li-turtle tilt" alt="turtle" />99th Annual Lodge Dinner <span class="label label-success">New</span></p>
	<p>The new year is just around the corner, and with it comes the annual lodge dinner. This dinner is one of the more popular events of the year, where awards are distributed including the Founders Award, Oustanding Service Awards, and Chuck Benshetler Spirit of Camp Leadership Award. The fun doesn't stop there, as this is the same event where the State of the Lodge is delivered, the new officers are inducted and many other lodge and national events are announced. This is also one of our events where the whole family is invited; guests don't need to belong to the O.A. or scouting. Officers from surrounding lodges, the section, region, and even national have been in attendance, so you might as well join them! You can <a href="http://colbsa.doubleknot.com/event/2015-lodge-annual-dinner/1595021" target="_blank">register online now</a>! Make sure you register by December 26, because after that a $5 late fee will be added on to each person.</p>

	<p class="subhead" id="Fall_Fellowship"><img src="images/SMTurtle.jpg" class="li-turtle tilt" alt="turtle">Fall Fellowship</p>
	<p>This past weekend sure was exciting as brothers from all over the Lodge came together to compete in the Highland Games and perform service for their fellow scouts. In the coming days, Photos will be uploaded to our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/unamione" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a> and <a href="photos">Photos Page</a>, so make sure you stay tuned! As for now, the winners of the election and your 2015 centennial executive officers is listed below. Below that, you can find the slideshow from this past weekend.</p>
	<p>We look forward to seeing you at the Annual Lodge Dinner in January! For a complete list of the projects completed, check it out on the <a href="communications-serviceupdate">Service Update Page</a>.</p>

	<p class="subhead" id="Treaty"><img src="images/SMTurtle.jpg" class="li-turtle tilt" alt="turtle">The Treaty of Renewed Friendship</p>
	<p>The morning of Sunday, August 17th, John Gerlach, Brett Davis, and Jason Scardecchio traveled to Cape May, NJ to attend and participate in the signing of the Treaty of Renewed Friendship.  The treaty brings together companies, organizations and individuals in an effort to respect and look after the original lands and water ways of the Lenape, chiefly the Delaware River.</p>
	<p>The event started with a gathering prayer and song, followed by each signatory being called on and recognized as they signed the treaty.  This year, Unami Lodge, One presented a gift to the Lenape Nation.  The first part of our gift  included a turtle shell, staghorn sumac, cedar branches and sage leaves which all have spiritual and cultural significance to the Lenape.  The second part of our gift was a canvas painting depicting the Lenape creation story with trees growing on the back of a swimming turtle.</p>
	<p>Following the signing, participants had the opportunity to mingle and check out many tables filled with crafts and indigenous art.  The event was concluded with a celebratory Pow Wow.</p>

	<a href="images/IMG_6038_medium.png" rel="lightbox" title="Steve Ranjo Memorial Clocktower"><img src="images/IMG_6038_small.png" class="pull-right"></a>
	<p>Two years ago July 21, Unami Lodge, One, Resica Falls Scout Reservation and the Cradle of Liberty Council lost a great Scouter and a dear friend. Steve Ranjo touched more lives in his 40 years then most people do in a lifetime. He lived the ideals of Scouting and the principles of the Order of the Arrow in his daily life. During this time, Steve served as Camp Director, Lodge Adviser and Council Vice President of Program.</p>
    <p>Memories of Steve still illuminate our hearts and consciences most brightly. Many hold the conversations they had with Steve close to their hearts. Whether just to catch up or to provide sage advice, Steve always made the time to talk to people.</p>
	<p>Fittingly, a central meeting place was chosen to remember Steve at Resica Falls. The Steve Ranjo Memorial Clock Tower serves as a lasting monument to Steve’s legacy. The Clock Tower serves as a place where knowledge is given and ideas shared, with the purpose of making camp and Scouting a better place.</p>

    <p class="subhead" id="vigil"><img src="images/SMTurtle.jpg" class="li-turtle tilt" alt="turtle">The 2014 Unami Lodge Vigil Class</p>
	<p>The Vigil Honor is the highest recognition a lodge can bestow upon its members for service to the lodge, the Order of the Arrow, Scouting, and the Scout Camp. Dating to 1915 when our founder, Dr. E. Urner Goodman, was inducted as the first Vigil Honor member, hundreds of Unami Lodge brothers have been chosen to keep their Vigil. At the Second Spring Service weekend at Resica Falls Scout Reservation, Unami Lodge inducted twelve brothers into the Vigil Honor in recognition of their dedicated and altruistic service. Those inducted were:</p>

	<p>The Vigil Honor Committee would like to express gratitude to all those brothers who helped to make the Vigil process a success. Preparing and executing the Vigil experience for twelve new members is a daunting task, and the Vigil brothers of the lodge accomplished it with cheer and enthusiasm. It would not have been possible without you.</p>

	<blockquote class="small"><p>Within the past year, Unami Lodge, One has achieved many goals. Each year, lodges across the nation strive for Gold in the Journey to Excellence program; I am proud to say that Unami achieved Gold in the Journey to Excellence program for 2013. I want to ensure Unami Lodge, One Gold in the Journey to Excellence program this year. We have a lot of work cut out for us within the year because our 100th Anniversary is approaching us swiftly. In a mere 10 months, Unami Lodge, One and the Order of the Arrow will begin celebrating its 100th Anniversary.</p></blockquote>
	<p>That is just a brief snippet from this year's Annual Report. For more information check out the <a href="files/forms/Unami_Lodge_Report_2014.pdf" target="_blank">2014 Annual Lodge Report</a>.</p>

	<a href="images/LegacyLid.JPG" rel="lightbox" title="Legacy Lid - John Gerlach"><img src="images/LegacyLidSmall.JPG" class="pull-right"></a>
	<blockquote class="small">
        <p>Now that your lodge's rock has been sent off, it's time to move forward with sharing your lodge's history with the rest of the country as we move towards celebrating the Order of the Arrow's 100th Anniversary.</p>
        <p>The next step is to ponder the legacy your lodge has left in the Order's first 100 years serving your council and the legacy your lodge wants to make in a new century of service. At last year's NOAC, each lodge was given a Centennial crate to assist lodges in celebrating the 100th anniversary of the OA. In 2013, your lodge's charge is to take the lid to this crate and paint it on one side to reflect your lodge's legacy. Consider incorporating the design for your 100th anniversary NOAC 2015 contingent flap into the lid design.</p>
        <p>Your lid should be kept by your lodge and put in a safe place. We will ask you to bring these to NOAC in 2015.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Our lid was designed and painted by John Gerlach. Thanks John for this excellent work.</p>
